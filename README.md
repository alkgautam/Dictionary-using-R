# Dictionary-using-R
This is an R program which takes a word and return its meaning

# Note:
This program requires R to be preinstalled. If not installed you can install it from CRAN.

The Dictionary txt file is inclded in the 'files' subfolder.

The dict.txt file is The Project Gutenberg EBook of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary of 2009 edition, so words added after that wont be there.
